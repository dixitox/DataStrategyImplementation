business_problem: Fuzzy matching is used in situations in which data-driven insights are required from disparate data sources but in which there are missing keys, messy data and/or unstructured data.
business_value: Relating data that does not have a primary-key relationship is helpful in many use cases, for example matching product SKUs for master data, matching people to skills for project management etc.
accelerator_description: "Best practices and resources for implementing fuzzy matching solutions. The repository is broken down into the following sections.
 \n- Data Management (record linkage)
 \n- People Matching
 \n- Knowledge Graphs"
modeling_approach_and_training: |
 Jupyter notebooks use sample data of company names from Nasdaq and S&P 500 data and use fuzzywuzzy and dask to implement  fuzzy matching at scale. 
value: The accelerator is useful to describe approaches and show examples of 'fuzzy matching', best practices by means of example notebooks.
data: Kaggle Sample dataset is provided.

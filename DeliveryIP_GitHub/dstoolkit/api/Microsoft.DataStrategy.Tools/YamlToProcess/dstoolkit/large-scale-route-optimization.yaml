business_problem: Creating an optimization engine that can automatically suggest the best route for product delivery. 
business_value: Increased delivery pace and cost decrease
accelerator_description: This accelerator provides the code template to solve large-scale route optimization problems.
modeling_approach_and_training: "Route optimization is modelled as a constraint programming problem, that can take on arbitrary real-world constraints. A parallelization framework is implemented for finding feasible solutions of large-scale optimization problems."
value: This accelerator provides you a framework to solve large-scale real-world route optimization problems.
data: This accelerator accepts data in a structured format, e.g., in CSV format. The data is expected to provide the information that can be used to formulate the route optimization problem. It also accepts a few user defined parameters, e.g., maximum number of stops per vehicle, for simulation purposes.

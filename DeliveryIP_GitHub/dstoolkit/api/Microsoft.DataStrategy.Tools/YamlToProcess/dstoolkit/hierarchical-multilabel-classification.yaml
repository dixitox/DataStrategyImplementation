business_problem: Create a hierarchical multi-label classifier, which explores all the “approaches” possible in hierarchical multi-label classification and recommends the best method.
business_value: Supports variety of use-cases in which classes are hierarchically structured and objects can be assigned to multiple paths of the class hierarchy at the same time, ex. text classification & image annotation.
accelerator_description: The labeling and layering in a hierarchical, multi-label classification (HMLC) model can be quite complex and take a significant amount of time, especially in discovering the best approach. This accelerator gives the best approach with all the models wrapped in a single model-like wrapper.
modeling_approach_and_training: "There are broadly three approaches to solving a multi-label classification: power-set labels, independent models and chained models. This accelerator explores all these approaches with different algorithms or model classes passed on by the users and returns a composite model-like artefact, which wraps the best approach and constituent models with the familiar Sklearn-like methods."
value: This accelerator cuts short the time required to discover the best approach in HMLC while being comprehensive search. Since it uses a very familiar interface, the learning curve is very short, while being very flexible in terms of usage.
data: "Labelled data in the form of Pandas dataframes containing input columns and label columns. Types of data that can be processed - 
 \n- Text
 \n- Numerical data (say, financial variance analysis)
 \n- Image data after pre-processing"

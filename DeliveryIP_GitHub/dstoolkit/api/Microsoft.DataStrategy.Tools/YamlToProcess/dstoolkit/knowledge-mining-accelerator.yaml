business_problem: Unstructured data volume is overwhelming business users as well as harming their productivity by generating unnecessary insights, searchability & discoverability obstacles.
business_value: End-to-End solution to mine unstructured data into business high-value actionable with better insights, full searchability & great discoverability.
accelerator_description: Knowledge mining (KM) is an emerging discipline in artificial intelligence (AI) that uses a combination of intelligent services to quickly learn from vast amounts of information. It allows organizations to deeply understand and easily explore information, uncover hidden insights, and find relationships and patterns at scale.

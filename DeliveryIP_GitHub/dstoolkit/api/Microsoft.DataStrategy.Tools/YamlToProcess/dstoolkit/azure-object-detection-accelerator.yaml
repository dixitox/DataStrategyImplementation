business_problem: "Solve business use-cases that include
 \n- Locating a target object or objects in images
 \n- Differentiate object types in images
 \n- Determine the sizes of objects in images"

business_value: "Automate visual tasks for example, 
 \n- Product inspection
 \n- Quality control / Defect detection
 \n- Item counting
 \n- Document analysis
 \n- Medical image analysis
 \n- Store surveilance"

accelerator_description: This repository serves as a starting point and accelerator for object detection projects on Azure. The walkthrough will help quickly setup training, labelling, inference, testing and deployment pipelines within a few minutes of setup. A starter dataset is generated for demonstration purposes to illustrate where to place project data. The pipelines clearly show the steps required so that changes can be easily made as required.
modeling_approach_and_training: The repo maintains a collection of different models. Pipelines automate the training. Users can configure the pipelines to use different models and datasets.

value: Fast and simple end-to-end setup of a sample object detection solution on Azure and customizable pipelines to accelerate computer vision projects.
data: A synthetic dataset is provided as a starting point and instructions are given on how to replace the dataset with project specific data.

business_problem: Manufacturing plants have huge eletricity demands for which prices are negotiated in advance with electricity providers. Understanding the eletricity profiles of machines based on a set of factors, like speed, heating, etc, is the first step in optimizting plant operations. 
business_value: 
  "- Cost reduction
  \n- Improved energy governance and control"
accelerator_description: The live demo shows how to organise machinery data, what kind of dashboard stakeholders are interested to use, and how to predict energy consumption from machines."
modeling_approach_and_training: A simple trained linear regression model is added to the repository.
data: Tabular data showing common machine controls like velocity, rotational speed, etc. The dataset is a dummy dataset based on past engagements. 
architecture:
  "- Azure App Services
  \n- Streamlit"
